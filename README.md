# Event Ticketing Service: A Simulation Platform for Developing and Testing Autonomous Agents using the Cognos Agent framework
This project works to develop a platform for training and testing custom LLM-based agents on a simulated business environment. The platform provides developers with a way to evaluate the performance of their agents against key performance indicators (KPIs) and performance metrics from various business channels, including a ticketing application, a financial reporting backend, a product analytics dashboard, social media channels, and more.

By using this platform, developers can create autonomous agents that can help increase operational efficiency in businesses. The platform allows developers to test and iterate their agents in a safe and controlled environment, reducing the risk of errors and minimizing downtime.

With the ability to train and test agents against realistic business scenarios, developers can gain valuable insights into how their agents will perform in real-world conditions. This can help developers fine-tune their agents for maximum efficiency and better prepare for challenges that may arise.

The project builds on the capacity of the CognosFramework](https://github.com/Myndshare/cognos) to train cooperative Agents for complex business workflows using KPI guidance, operational control logic, advanced tool selection and effective human supervision and self regulation. 

### Disclaimer!! 
Both projects are yet to be implemented, and are done so purely on an experimental basis by the author to dive into and explore the possibilities of autonomous agent applications for real-world business contexts. It is a evening hobbie project outside of work that does not receive continued attention. If you feel passionate about the topic, feel free to reach out and contribute.

## Motivation and scope
This is an example project that showcases how agents can be used to control business flows within an pure online environment. The project also provides customizable event streams to the service to simulate changes in business and see how agents can self-regulate. Furthermore, it demonstrates how a KPI-driven agent control and integration framework can function, enabling autonomous organizations driven by software agents to be guided through ties to commonly shared business metrics.

## Business simulation
The business modeled by the event ticketing application is a company that sells tickets to various events, such as concerts, sporting events, and theater productions. The company works with event organizers to promote and sell tickets to customers, providing a platform for customers to search and browse events, purchase tickets, and manage their orders. The company may also offer additional services, such as VIP packages, special promotions, and customer support. Overall, the goal of the business is to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for both event organizers and customers, while generating revenue through ticket sales and related services.

### KPIs
* Ticket sales revenue: This is a critical KPI for any ticketing business, as it directly impacts the company's bottom line. One challenge in the current market condition is the unpredictability of the pandemic, which can greatly affect ticket sales for events.

* Customer satisfaction: The satisfaction of customers who purchase tickets through the platform is important for building brand loyalty and repeat business. However, the challenge is to ensure that the customers are satisfied with the experience even when events are cancelled or postponed due to unforeseen circumstances.

* Time to resolution for customer support tickets: Prompt resolution of customer support tickets is important for maintaining a positive relationship with customers. However, the challenge is to provide timely resolution without sacrificing quality and accuracy of support.

* Conversion rate: The percentage of visitors who actually purchase tickets on the platform is an important KPI that impacts the company's revenue. One challenge in the current market condition is to ensure that the platform is able to attract visitors and convert them into paying customers despite the uncertainty around the pandemic.

* Cost per acquisition: The cost of acquiring each new customer is an important KPI that impacts the profitability of the business. The challenge is to keep the cost per acquisition low while still attracting high-quality customers who are likely to make repeat purchases.

* Time to market for new events: The ability to quickly add new events to the platform and make them available for sale is important for staying competitive in the market. However, the challenge is to ensure that the events are properly vetted and meet quality standards before they are made available on the platform.

## Roadmap

I am working to develop a realistic business environment simulation for the organization's agents to interact with. This will provide a robust platform for the testing and development of agent-based control and integration frameworks, which can be used to drive autonomous organizational patterns. The roadmap will involve implementing several mock backends, such as financial and departmental expense tracking, and a mock social media environment to simulate content engagement across various media channels. Additionally, a controllable mock activity stream for product analytics will be added to provide real-time feedback on the system's performance.

* Implement a mock financial backend for agents to transact against
  - Create a mock financial backend that agents can use to transact against.
  - Implement functionality for agents to check their account balance and perform transactions.

* Implement a mock logic for running expenses in the business by department
  - Create a mock environment that simulates business expenses by department.
  - Implement functionality for agents to track expenses and adjust budgets.

* Implement a mock social media environment to simulate content engagement across common media channels for short messaging, articles, news, media
  - Create a mock social media environment that simulates content engagement across common media channels.
  - Implement functionality for agents to track engagement metrics and adjust content strategy.

* Add a controllable mock activity stream for your product analytics
  - Create a mock activity stream that simulates user behavior and product usage.
  - Implement functionality for agents to analyze user behavior and adjust product strategy accordingly.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses the [AWS Amplify Framework](https://aws-amplify.github.io/) to manage the backend.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

### Installation

To install the project dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

### Configuration

To configure the Amplify framework for this project, run the following command:

```
amplify configure
```

This command will guide you through the process of setting up an AWS account and creating an IAM user for Amplify.

After configuring Amplify, you can create the backend resources for this project by running the following command:

```
amplify init
```

This command will prompt you to select the type of backend you want to create. Choose "GraphQL API" and follow the prompts to create the API.

### Usage

To start the development server, run the following command:

```
npm start
```

This command will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.

### Deploying

To deploy the application to a production environment, run the following command:

```
npm run build
amplify publish
```

This command will build the application for production and deploy it to the AWS infrastructure you created earlier.
