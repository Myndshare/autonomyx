# Event Ticketing Service

This is an example project that showcases how agents can be used to control business flows in a service. The project also provides customizable event streams to the service to simulate changes in business and see how agents can self-regulate. It showcases the power of the myndshare.ai agent/human integration framework to enable autonomous organizations driven by software agents. 

This project provides a customizable event stream to simulate changes in the business and see how agents can self-regulate. Furthermore, it demonstrates how a KPI-driven agent control and integration framework can function, enabling autonomous organizations driven by software agents.

In developing this project, I used the Amplify framework to provide a seamless backend infrastructure, which allowed me to focus on creating the frontend application. Amplify made it easy to set up a GraphQL API, add authentication and authorization to the app, and use Amazon S3 for file storage.

## Roadmap

I am working to develop a realistic business environment simulation for the organization's agents to interact with. This will provide a robust platform for the testing and development of agent-based control and integration frameworks, which can be used to drive autonomous organizational patterns. The roadmap will involve implementing several mock backends, such as financial and departmental expense tracking, and a mock social media environment to simulate content engagement across various media channels. Additionally, a controllable mock activity stream for product analytics will be added to provide real-time feedback on the system's performance.

* Implement a mock financial backend for agents to transact against
  - Create a mock financial backend that agents can use to transact against.
  - Implement functionality for agents to check their account balance and perform transactions.

* Implement a mock logic for running expenses in the business by department
  - Create a mock environment that simulates business expenses by department.
  - Implement functionality for agents to track expenses and adjust budgets.

* Implement a mock social media environment to simulate content engagement across common media channels for short messaging, articles, news, media
  - Create a mock social media environment that simulates content engagement across common media channels.
  - Implement functionality for agents to track engagement metrics and adjust content strategy.

* Add a controllable mock activity stream for your product analytics
  - Create a mock activity stream that simulates user behavior and product usage.
  - Implement functionality for agents to analyze user behavior and adjust product strategy accordingly.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses the [AWS Amplify Framework](https://aws-amplify.github.io/) to manage the backend.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

### Installation

To install the project dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

### Configuration

To configure the Amplify framework for this project, run the following command:

```
amplify configure
```

This command will guide you through the process of setting up an AWS account and creating an IAM user for Amplify.

After configuring Amplify, you can create the backend resources for this project by running the following command:

```
amplify init
```

This command will prompt you to select the type of backend you want to create. Choose "GraphQL API" and follow the prompts to create the API.

### Usage

To start the development server, run the following command:

```
npm start
```

This command will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.

### Deploying

To deploy the application to a production environment, run the following command:

```
npm run build
amplify publish
```

This command will build the application for production and deploy it to the AWS infrastructure you created earlier.
